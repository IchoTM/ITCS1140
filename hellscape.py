#i love how I don't even need to insert memes to make this code not make sense#
#the examples we are given don't make sense to begin with :)#

#I want to make a version of this that actually may do something usefull but on the other hand that#
#Is alot of coding that I kinda dont wanna do and it might mess up the example.#

NumBals()
print("Leaving already? 3:")

#why have balls become my singnature coding phrase#
#what happened to me? :(#
